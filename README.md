## What is Vape V4?
Vape V4 is an exploit software script often used in Roblox games, primarily associated with unauthorized advantages, like aiming aids or speed boosts, in competitive games like BedWars. This script, distributed on platforms like GitHub, has evolved over multiple versions and incorporates a user interface for toggling features such as combat aids, rendering tools, and automation scripts. Users can implement various modules for activities like customizing in-game overlays or automating gameplay actions. Developed over several years, Vape V4 is one of the more robust tools for creating custom advantages, though its use is against Roblox's Terms of Service and may result in account bans if detected.

Scripts like Vape V4 are accessed through third-party libraries and require specific code injections to execute in-game, which is often circulated via sites like Pastebin.
